Databases! Learned about junction tables, learned about how to save data in not one, but two tables - you need the post_id automatically created by Supabase before you can add the related tags in the posts_tags table!! Learned about how to make a JOIN SQL command.

ON DELETE CASCASE. Learned about how I should have set up on delete CASCADE command when making my junction tables - before I altered my junction table, I could not just delete a posts row because of cascading!
